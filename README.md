# My Jekyll-based website

In an attempt to share my process with anyone that is interested, this is the source for my new website, built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I will be writing a fairly lengthy post about the process of setting up a Jekyll based site from scratch- I didn't have to do much to import my previous WordPress based site, since there was not a lot of content I wanted to carry over.

I am sure there are ways I could optimize it further, and I would love to hear suggestions- please open an issue or a pull request.

I can be reached by [email](mailto:nk@nachiketkumar.com) or [twitter](http://twitter.com/nachiketkumar).
