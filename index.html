      <h1>Hello! I'm Nachiket.</h1>
      <p class="subhead">I live in Atlanta &amp; design web and mobile interfaces.</p>
      <p>I am a designer by way of a scientist. I studied biology and worked in research for many years before deciding that my heart lay in design.</p>
      <p>I currently lead design at <a href="http://curriapp.com">Curri</a>, a small education technology company. We are working on making the development bootcamp environment more productive and enjoyable for students and teachers.</p>
      <p>I am interested in product design, and working on interesting ideas with interesting people. I believe that good typography makes a world of a difference, and that content comes first.</p>
      <p>I am available for selected freelance work. You can take a look at some of my <a href="/work">projects</a>, follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/nachiketkumar">twitter</a>, or just shoot me an <a href="mailto:nk@nachiketkumar.com?subject=hello">email</a> to say hello.</p>
