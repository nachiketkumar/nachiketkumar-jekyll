      <h3>1. Initial Meeting</h3>
      <p>The first meeting is about me trying to understand your needs and giving you a sense about how I work.</p>
      <p>At the end of the meeting, I need to be clear about:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Why do you <strong>want</strong> and/or <strong>need</strong> a new website? This should address business needs.</li>
        <li>Who are your <strong>primary</strong> and <strong>secondary</strong> audiences?</li>
        <li>How will you <strong>measure success</strong> in outcome?</li>
        <li>Do you have a <strong>list of requirements</strong> for the new site? Type of content, content management system <span class="small">(CMS)</span>, must-have features etc?</li>
        <li>Do you have access to the <strong>Google Analytics</strong> account?</li>
        <li>Do you have a <strong>budget</strong> in mind?</li>
        <li>Do you need help with <strong>hosting</strong> the website?</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>2. Audit and Proposal</h3>
      <p>Much like you in the medical field, I make decisions based on evidence. Your Google Analytics data will give us a lot of insight about what your users are looking for and what parts of your site they visit.</p>
      <p>Equally important is what sections of your site they <strong>don't visit</strong>. Part of my role is as a curator, to advise you on the appropriate information to show on your website.</p>
      <p>If after the first meeting, you are interested in moving forward, the first step is to do an audit of your existing website to understand current trends. I will need access to your Google Analytics account in order to do this. Combined with the requirements you present me, I will then give you a concrete proposal covering <strong>costs &amp; deliverables</strong>.</p>
      <p>Considering this effort takes time and is crucial to creating a website that will serve you well for years to come, I charge a flat <strong>$500 fee</strong> for the audit.</p>
      <p>This fee is payable before I start the audit. I will deliver the findings as a separate <span class="small">PDF</span> file along with my proposal, and this is yours to keep. If you decide to continue with the work, we can take it from there, but you are under no obligation to engage my services beyond this stage.</p>
      <h3>3. Agreement</h3>
      <p>If you are interested in moving on beyond the audit phase, we will sign a contract based on the proposal.</p>
      <p>The contract will cover:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Scope of work: What I am and am not responsible for.</li>
        <li>Deliverables: How many pages am I building, and whether a <span class="small">CMS</span> is included or not.</li>
        <li>Work plan: What the various stages and accompanying dates shall be.</li>
        <li>Payment schedule: When are payments due.</li>
        <li>Legal matters: Liability etc.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>4. Build</h3>
      <p>Once the contract has been signed, I require a 40% deposit of the project cost in order to start work. The contract shall set out the payment schedule, but usually another 30% is due at a middle stage, with the balance due upon completion.</p>
      <p>At this stage, the signed contract takes precedence over anything stated on this website. However, the general process is the following, and each step requires approval before moving forward:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Sketching layouts— these are lo-fidelity.</li>
        <li>Deciding on design elements— fonts, colors, use of images/icons etc. I like to do this in the form of <a href="http://styletil.es/">Style Tiles</a>.</li>
        <li>Interactive prototype— a working website.</li>
        <li>Final website.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>5. Delivery</h3>
      <p>Upon receipt of the final payment, I move the website from my staging server to your hosting server and make sure everything is working as it should.</p>
      <p>We shake hands and get back to work!</p>
