      <p>I started making the move from immunology research to design around 5 years ago. About a year ago, I actually started working in the design industry. Here’s a <a href="http://resume.nachiketkumar.com">brief look</a> at my past; it should reflect the hard work I’ve put in to get myself to this stage. Now, I’m ready for a lot more!</p>
      <p>I saw the opportunity to apply for this position at almost the exact same time as I was starting to <a href="http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bb-high-five.gif" target="blank" title="had to have a gif!">finally redesign</a> my own site. I had designed a new logo some time ago <em>(:hover!)</em>, so I decided to start with this page.</p>
      <p>That’s why it looks so different from the rest of my site. I’m experimenting here with type choices, colors and layout (though this page is somewhat Pixel Union branded). Within the next week, I’m going to gut the old site and put up the new one. In the meantime, you can take a look at my <em>(outdated)</em> <a href="http://nachiketkumar.com">site</a> and projects. It makes me cringe to leave the old stuff up, but it’s a good reminder (to me at least) of my progress.</p>

          <li>I think 'years of experience' is just a number.</li>
          <li>I’ve learned a <strong>lot</strong> in the past couple of years...</li>
          <li>...and even more in the last nine months: Rails, Sass, Jekyll &amp; Git.</li>

      <p>Part of the reason for quitting my agency job in May last year was coming across the opportunity to attend a <a href="http://hackeryou.com">Rails bootcamp</a>. I spent 9 weeks at Shopify <span class="small">HQ</span>, learning Rails and improving my front-end chops.</p>
      <p>When it comes to web and product design, I know I’m light-years ahead of where I would have been had I stayed in my branding agency job. In the last year, I’ve radically improved my front end skills. I can whip up a responsive website from scratch, I think about <span class="small">CSS</span> in a <a href="http://smacss.com/">modular fashion</a>, I focus on typography and I’m always trying to better my visual design abilities.</p>
      <p>After the HackerYou bootcamp ended, I got together with a small group of people in the late fall to continue working on our <a href="http://curriapp.com">final project</a>. As the only designer on the team, I’ve handled all the design and front-end code (except <span class="small">JS</span>), with input from the rest of the group. We are trying to figure out if we have an actual product or not. I enjoyed learning and using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a> to make the Curri homepage, so I’m continuing to use it for my own website redesign. Part of this effort includes writing a detailed tutorial about creating a website using Jekyll, which I hope will be useful to newbies.</p>
      <p>In the last 9 months, I’ve gotten comfortable building simple Rails apps, working in Rails views, using Sass, learning Jekyll and always refactoring. While I have a long way to go, I’ve shown that I can quickly learn new techniques and technologies.</p>

          <li>Quality over quantity.</li>
          <li>My recent projects have been in-depth, and responsive.</li>
          <li>I’ve worked on numerous design challenges in them.</li>

      <p>I have spent the last ~7 months working on projects which give a much better sense of my ability than what’s in my portfolio. I have gone pretty deep into the design process for both: <a href="http://curriapp.com">Curri</a> and <a href="http://diabetesplusme.com">Diabetes+Me</a>, both of which have had significant responsive design challenges. I went from never having designed a responsive site to single-handedly designing a responsive app.</p>
      <p>While I can’t share logins for the latter since they are still in private beta, I can share some <span class="small">UI</span> mockups and talk about the design challenges. The landing page I designed and built (front-end code except for <span class="small">JS</span>) is open for scrutiny. Spending time on these projects has been the best learning experience I could have asked for.</p>
      <p>I would be happy for you to log into Curri and have a look around, and I can give you the credentials if you’re interested.</p>

          <li>The chance to work on products that millions of people use.</li>
          <li>You <strong>get</strong> the new model for work&mdash; no more 9&ndash;5, remote work FTW!</li>
          <li>You understand that people do best when given trust and responsibility.</li>
          <li>I want to push myself by working with other talented designers.</li>

    <div class="column two-thirds">
      <p>Working on products that I know will be seen and used by thousands, if not millions of people is extremely exciting. Not only that, I’d still have enough time to work on projects I’m interested in outside of work. I’ve learned how important this is to me in the last year, in terms of keeping things interesting and growing my skills. I’ll still be able to enjoy many of the perks of freelancing while learning from and contributing to Pixel Union&mdash; working from home and being able to do work that engages me.</p>
      <p>You understand the daftness in limiting who you work with to a narrow geographical location, and that people work best when they are given responsibility and trust. You know that in the knowledge industry, 9&mdash;5 is old news. I suspect you are as fond as I am of what the folks at Basecamp think about these issues.</p>
      <p>When I made the decision to go out on my own last year, I was in a very different place in my life. I was fed up of working in a job I didn’t see a future in, and I felt I had wasted enough time. The last year has been stressful yet oddly rejuvenating, but now the best way to push myself further is to work with other talented designers.</p>
      <p>In taking this risk, I was able to go <a href="http://nachiketkumar.com/journey-on-rails/">learn Rails</a>, meet and work with <a href="http://curriapp.com/about">fascinating</a> and <a href="http://rimidi.com/team.html">brilliant</a> people and improve my skills. I realized that product design, and working on interesting problems with interesting people, is what I really enjoy. Today I feel confident in the foundation I have and ready to contribute to a successful product.</p>
