      <p>The opportunity to apply for this position came up at almost the exact same time as I was starting to <a href="http://www.reactiongifs.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/bb-high-five.gif" target="blank" title="had to have a gif!">finally redesign</a> my own site. I had designed a new logo some time ago <em>(:hover!)</em>, so I decided to start with this page. I'm experimenting here with type choices, colors and layout (though this page <em>is</em> somewhat Treehouse branded). Within the next 10 days, I'm going to gut the old site and put up the new one.</p>
      <p>I enjoyed using Jekyll to make the <a href="http://curriapp.com">Curri homepage</a>, so I'm going to take a break from Wordpress for this. Part of my redesign effort includes writing a detailed tutorial about creating a website using Jekyll. In the meantime, you can take a look at my <em>(outdated)</em> <a href="http://nachiketkumar.com">site</a> and projects. It makes me cringe to leave the old stuff up, but it's a good reminder (to me at least) of the progress I've made.</p>

      <p>When it comes to web and product design, I know I'm light-years ahead of where I would have been had I stayed in my branding agency job. In the last year, I've radically improved my front end skills. I can whip up a responsive website from scratch, I think about CSS in a <a href="http://smacss.com/">modular fashion</a>, I focus on typography and I'm always trying to better my visual design abilities.</p>
      <p>While I have a long way to go, I've shown that I can quickly learn new techniques and technologies. I believe I check the rest of your requirements, and I hope you agree.</p>

        <h3><img class="star" src="/assets/star.svg">tl;dr</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>My recent projects have been in-depth.</li>
          <li>I've worked on numerous design challenges in them.</li>

      <p>I have spent the last ~7 months working on projects which give a much better sense of my ability than what's in my portfolio. I have gone pretty deep into the design process for both: <a href="http://curriapp.com">Curri</a>&mdash; which I talked about more than enough in the answers to the interview questions, and <a href="http://diabetesplusme.com">Diabetes+Me</a>.</p>
      <p>While I can't share logins for the latter since they are still in private beta, I can share some UI mockups and talk about the design challenges. The landing page I designed is open for scrutiny. Spending time on these projects has been the best learning experience I could have asked for.</p>

      <h2>4. Do I want to stop freelancing?</h2>

        <ol>
          <li>I'm not applying for this job because I don't want to freelance anymore.</li>
          <li>The best way for me to improve now is to work with other designers.</li>
          <li>I feel ready to contribute to a project like Treehouse.</li>

    <div class="column two-thirds">
      <p>It's not that I want to stop freelancing, but when I made the decision to go freelance, I was in a very different place in my life. I was fed up of working in a job I didn't see a future in, and I felt I had wasted enough time. The last year has been stressful yet oddly rejuvenating, but now I think the best way to push myself further is to work with other talented designers.</p>
      <p>Going out on my own allowed me the chance to go <a href="http://nachiketkumar.com/journey-on-rails/">learn Rails</a>, meet and work with <a href="http://curriapp.com/about">fascinating</a> and <a href="http://rimidi.com/team.html">brilliant</a> people, and realize that product design, and working on interesting problems with interesting people, is what I really enjoy. Now I'm at a stage where I feel confident in the foundation I have and ready to contribute to a successful product.</p>
      <p>The great thing about working for Treehouse is that I'd still have enough time to work on projects I'm interested in outside of work. I've learned how important this is to me in the last year. I'll still be able to enjoy many of the perks of freelancing while learning from and contributing to Treehouse&mdash; working from home and being able to do work that engages me.</p>
